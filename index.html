            <h2>World Cup (WC) Popularity</h2>
            <p>Sports is one of, if not the most exciting platforms in the entertainment industry. According to a recent <a href="https://www.roadtrips.com/blog/the-most-watched-sporting-events-in-the-world/" target="_blank">survey</a> 
            (July 2022), the international  <span class="worldcup_text">Men's soccer world cup</span> is amongst the most popular sports event in the world, garnering about <span class="worldcup_text">3.3 Billion</span> viewers. 
            With massive marketing and adverstising being carried out across the world, the number of viewers is expected to keep increasing.

              <h2>Growing interest for the World Cup</h2>
              <p>In the early years of this competition, there were not as many matches as there are today. In 1930, only <b>18 games</b> were played. It was not until the 
                1998 World Cup that the current world cup format of <b>64 games</b> has been introduced. This, on top of increasing accessibility to watch soccer games, explains
                the gradual increase of spectators over the years.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>It is interesting to observe from the line chart that there were no World Cups held in 1942 and 1946. Do you know why?
              <b>This is because those 2 World Cups have been cancelled due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup#:~:text=The%20planned%201942%20and%201946,group%20of%20the%20final%20round." target="_blank">World War 2</a> and its aftermath.</b>

          <h2>Goal Galore in WCs</h2>
          <p>Most memorable World Cup moments almost all generate from the spectacular goals which are scored throughout this competition.</p>
          <p>The box and whisker plot on the right demonstrates an overview of how previous World Cup winners fared in these competitions and offers some interesting insights.</p> 
          <p>  
            For example, <span class="italy">4</span> times winner <span class="italy">Italy</span> may not be the most spectacular offensively scoring 
            an average number of <span class="italy">10</span> goals per world cup, but still manage to be neck-to-neck with <span class="germany">Germany</span> in terms of WC wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, scoring goals is not all that is the most important. It is crucial for teams to have a solid defence, i.e concede least amount of goals as possible.
            The box and whisker plot and bubble plots can be analysed in conjunction to help you predict your 2022 World Cup Winner.
          </p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Good Luck!</h2>
